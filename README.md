# Fake API

Uses `My Json Server` site to fake an API, which basically reflects the JSON from the `db.json` file in the route of this repo. It doesn't matter what fields your json has so it can fake any data.

API accessible via [https://my-json-server.typicode.com/faulkner368/fake-api/db](https://my-json-server.typicode.com/faulkner368/fake-api/db)

### Notes
* You can use `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH` and `DELETE` requests. However, changes aren't persisted between calls.
